### 5. Develop static site
#### ___A - Directory & Git Setup
* Go to your home directory: 
 	* **cd ~**
* Go to your Documents directory
	* **cd Documents** 	 	
* make a directory called 'repos'
	* **mkdir repositories**
* change into the directory called 'repos'
	* **cd repositories**
* make a directory called 'catster_static' (this is the frst site we'll create)
	* **mkdir catster_static**
* Change into the 'catster_static' directory	
	* **cd catster_static**
* Tell Git to start watching this folder (Initialize)
	* **git init**
* Open Sublime text so you are have **catster_static** files on the left 
	* Open the app in Sublime Text so we can look at it. 
	* Use spotlight to open Sublime Text. Then got to **File > Open** and navagate to **~/Documents/repositories**. Select **catster_static** and press open.

#### ___B - HTML & Strucutre
* We are going to recreate <a href="https://github.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/tree/master/resources/static_site" target="_blank">resources > static-site</a>. 
* We'll call this *'The Resource Site'* for reference.
* Let's call what we build *'The Working Site'*
* We'll copy each component in one by one and see what it adds. 
* Inside of <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> create **index.html**
	* Add 'Hello World' to the file and then open with the Chrome browser  
* Create folders named 'css', 'fonts', 'images', and 'js'
* Delete the text 'Hello World' from Working site index.html file
* Copy the html from <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp" target="_blank">www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro</a> into index.html and refresh your chrome browser
	* What is a Tag?
	* What is the head tag doing?
	* What is the body tag doing?
	* How would we create a link?
<br>
<br>

* Copy contents of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/master/resources/static_site/index.html" target="_blank">index.html in the Resource site</a> to the index.html file in the Working working site.
	* Refresh the browser. What's going on?
		* Why is some text bigger?
		* Why are some text underlined
		* Why are some text in buttons

	 
<br>



#### ___C - CSS
* In your Working site create two files inside the css folder, **bootstrap.css** and **business-frontpage.css**. 
* Copy the contents of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/master/resources/static_site/css/bootstrap.css" target="_blank">bootstrap.css</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/master/resources/static_site/css/business-frontpage.css" target="_blank">business-frontpage.css</a> into their respecive files.
* Refresh the browser
* Open the image <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/master/resources/static_site/images/dusty_wide_dark_2.jpg" target="_blank">dusty_wide_dark_2.jpg</a>. Right click and **Save Image As** into **~/Documents/repositories/catster_static/images**
* Refresh the browser
* What is going on?
	* How did the index.html file even know about these new CSS files?
	 

* Hmmm let's look at some <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp" target="_blank">CSS Syntax</a>
* Whats going on?
	* How is the word 'Catster' getting sytled? 
	* How are voting buttons being colored
	* Where the images coming from?
* Lets look at the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools" target="_blank">Chrome Inspector Tool</a>
	* What if you want to be on the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/30under30/#/venture-capital" target="_blank">Forbes 30 under 30 list?</a> 	
<br>
* Notice the Voting button have squares
	* Copy in the files from the 'fonts' folder (similiar to 'css' folder) and refresh
<br><br>
* But more importantly...	 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9iafa959JvY" target="_blank"><img src="http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/55ad435f371d22472c8b5c13/why-gif-should-be-pronounced-giff-and-not-jiff.jpg"></a>

<br>

#### ___D - Javascript & JQuery
* Create and copy the files in the <a href="https://github.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/tree/master/resources/static_site/js" target="_blank">'js' folder from the Resource site</a> to the Working site
* Look at the voting buttons
* Notice that votes aren't saved when the browser is refreshed. Why not? What do we need? 

#### ___E - Push to Github & Deploy (The Interwebs)
* Go to <a href="https://github.com/new" target="_blank">github.com/new</a> and create a new repository. Call it something like **catster_static**
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/master/curriculum/images/new_repository.png" height=400>

<br>

* Copy the line that looks something like this:
	* **git remote add origin https://github.com/dladowitz/catster_static.git**
	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/master/curriculum/images/add_remote.png">
	
<br>
	
* Go back to your Command Line (Make sure you are in the catster_static directory)
* Add the copied address to git as a remote
	* **git remote add origin https://github.com/dladowitz/catster_static.git** (make sure to use your endpoint, not mine)
* Verify a remote was added
	* **git remote v** (you should see a fetch and push) 
* Add your changes to git 
	* **git add .**
* Commit your changes to git
	* **git commit -m "finishing static site"** 
* Verify your changes are added and commited
	* **git status**
	* You should see a line that says 'Nothing to commit, working directory clean'
* Push to github
	* **git push origin master -u**
* Go back to github refresh the page. You should  your code is up there.
* Create a <a href="http://paperplane.io/" target="_blank">paperplane.io</a> account
* Create a site linked to your github repository
	* For the name and url use something like 'your_name_catster_static' 
	* For some reason the paperplane link shows up wrong. You need to remove **https://www.paperplane.io** from the begining of the url. 	* It should look ike **catster-static.paperplane.io/**

#### It's Hi-Five time. 
<img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/91/f1/a3/91f1a31ba9edbbacd9243aa2e8ab1d7b.gif" height=500>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<hr>

### 6. Lets learn some Ruby
* We'll use one of <a href="http://railsbridge.org/" target="_blank">Railsbridge's</a> tutorials. They are a super good organization and a great place to continue learning. 
* Open up <a href="http://docs.railsbridge.org/ruby/ruby" target="_blank">Ruby for Beginners</a>.
* We won't go over all the sections of the tutorial.

#### ___A - Create the workspace
* In Terminal create a folder called 'ruby_practice'
	* **cd ~/Documents/repositories**
	* **mkdir ruby_practice**
* Change into that folder
	* **cd ruby_practice** 


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>

### 7. Lets make a Rails App
<br>

#### ___A - Create the base app
* Open Terminal and move to your ** repositories ** folder
	* **cd ~/Documents/repositories**
* Start a new Rails App
	* **rails new catster_app**
* Change into the directory of the new app
	* **cd catster_app**
* Tell git to start watching the app (initialize)
	* **git init**
	* **git add .**
	* **git commit -m "first commit"**
* Open the app in Sublime Text so we can look at it. 
	* Use spotlight to open Sublime Text. Then got to **File > Open** and navagate to **~/Documents/repositories**. Select **catster_app** and press open.
* Start the app
	* 	**rails server**
	* 	Note that the logs now run in Terminal and your commands don't work. You'll need to open a new terminal tab to keep working
* View your app in a broswer
	* Open the Chrome browser and go to the address 'localhost:3000'
	* Congrats, you have a Rails app running. (Ok, it's not that awesome. Let's make it awesomer)
<br>

	
#### ___B - Add Cat Gifs
* Go back to your terminal and we'll create a cat gif (make sure you are not in the tab showing server logs)
	* **rails generate scaffold CatGif title:string url:string score:integer**
	* **rails generate scaffold Signup email_address:string**
* Update the SQL Database
	* **rake db:migrate**
* Go look at the CatGifs page in the Chrome browser
	* go to <a href="http://localhost:3000/cat_gifs" target=_"blank">localhost:3000/cat_gifs</a>
	* click on the 'New Cat Gif' link. 
	* Find a cat gif on the internet. Copy the url. Add the url and a title to your new cat gif. Leave the score alone for now. Click 'Create Cat gif'.
	* Click on 'Back' and create a second one. 
	* Click on 'Back' and view the CatGif page. Its neat, but still not that awesome. 
* Make the actual GiF show up
	* Find the file that controls the HTML on this page (app>views>cat_gifs>index.html.erb)
	* Find the line that currently adds the url to the screen. It's probably on line 19 and it looks like this: 
	<br>
	**\<td><%= cat_gif.url %>\</td>**
	* Replace it with this: **\<td><%= image_tag(cat_gif.url, size: "200x200") %>\</td>**
* Refresh the browser. What happened?

<br>


#### ___C -  Make the CatGifs page Awesome
* Ok more awesome, but not awesome enough. Lets step it up. 
* Overwrite app>views>cat_gifs>index.html.erb with new code.
	* You can <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/master/resources/rails_app/app/views/cat_gifs/index.html.erb" target="_blank">find the new index.html.erb code here on github</a>
* Also overwrite app>controllers>cat_gifs_controller.rb
	* You can <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/master/resources/rails_app/app/controllers/cat_gifs_controller.rb" target="_blank">find cat_gifs_controller.rb here on github</a>
* Hmmmm, seems less awesome than before. Where did the cats go?
* Looks like we need a bunch of CSS files. We'll use the two we created for the static site. 
* We'll need to create two new files in app>assets>stylesheets (**bootstrap.css** and **business-frontpage.css**)
* Then copy the code from <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/master/resources/rails_app/app/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.css" target=_"blank">bootstrap.css on github</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/master/resources/rails_app/app/assets/stylesheets/business-frontpage.css" target=_"blank">business-frontpage.css on github</a> into each file respectively.  


#### Now refresh the page. 
<img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/59/a4/09/59a40966a86fe5a046193763380adfaf.jpg" height=400px"">

<br>

* Add some more cat gifs before we move on.

<br>

#### But how is this working?
* Lets talk about the MVC Pattern first (Model View Controller)
![](http://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/rails/mvc-rails.png)

* Go look at what is in the current SQL database. Either by sqlitebrowser or the console. 

<br>

#### ___D -  Make voting work (and fix the homepage)
* Try going to <a href="http://localhost:3000" target=_"blank">localhost:3000</a>
* Go back to <a href="http://localhost:3000/cat_gifs" target=_"blank">localhost:3000/cat_gifs</a> and try to UpVote or DownVote a gif
<br>

* We need to update the routes file (config>routes.rb) with a new code. 
	* <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/master/resources/rails_app/config/routes.rb" target=_"blank">find the new routes.rb on github</a> 
* Now refresh and try voting on the homepage. 
* Lets fix the missing arrows on the voting buttons. 
	* Inside the **catster_app > public** folder create a new folder called **fonts**
		* The **public** folder is that the root of you app.  
	* Go to <a href="https://github.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/blob/master/resources/rails_app/public/fonts/glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff" target=_"blank">glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff on github</a> 
	* Click on "View Raw" and save to **public>fonts**
	
<br>

#### ___E - Push to Github
* In the Termminal add and commit to git
	* **git add .**
	* **git commit -m "updating home page to be awesome"**
* Create a new repository on Github
	* Go to <a href="https://github.com/new" target="_blank">github.com/new</a> and create a new repository
	* Name is something like **catster_app** (maybe use your name)
	* Copy the line that looks something like:
	
	 **git remote add origin https://github.com/dladowitz/catster_app.git**
	 
	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/master/curriculum/images/add_remote_catster_app.png">

	<br>

	* Paste the line you just copied into the terminal and press enter. 
	* Type **git remote -v** and verify you have two endpoints created (fetch and push)
* Push your code to Github for safe keeping
	* In terminal type **git push -u origin master**
* If you refresh the Github browser page you should see all your code. 
 
<br>

#### ___F - Deploy to Heroku
* First we have to update the file called **Gemfile** (it will be at the root of your app)
	* Copy the code from <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/master/resources/rails_app/Gemfile" target="_blank">Gemfile on Github</a> to your app
* Bundle the new gems
	* In Terminal type **sudo bundle install --without production**
* Stop and start you local server
	* In Terminal find the tab with the server logs. Press **CTRL+C** then restart the server with **rails server**
* Go back to the other Termainl tab. Add and commit to git.
	* **git add .**
	* **git commit -m "updating gemfile"** 
	* **git push origin master**	 	
<br>	
* Go to <a href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank">heroku.com</a> and create an account if you don't have one. 
* Make sure you remember your username and password, you'll need it soon. 
* From the catster_app folder in the Terminal create a new heroku app
	* **heroku create your-name-catster-app** 
* Push your code to heroku
	* **git push heroku master**	
* Update the database on Heroku
	* In the terminal type **heroku run rake db:migrate** 
* View on heroku
	* In the Terminal type **heroku open** and a browser will open to your app 
	* If you get a broken page add `/cat_gifs` to the end of the url in the address bar

<br>

#### ___G - Add a Header & Footer (optional)
* Go look in the <a href="https://github.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/tree/master/resources/rails_app/app/views/layouts" target="_blank">app>views>layouts folder on GitHub</a>. Make the layout folder in your app look like this.
	* Note that **_header.html.erb** and **_footer.html.erb** begin with an underscore. 

<br>

#### ___H - Update the Add a Cat page (optional)
* You're on your own for this one. (Hint: **new.html.erb**)
* What if you wanted to remove the **Score** input box from this page?

<br>

#### ___I - Add a Contact Page (optional)
* You'll need to add a **app>controllers>contact_controller.rb** file and find the right code
* As well as a **contact** folder in the **views** folder
* Then find the code for **index.html.erb** (watch out there is more than one file with this name) file and add it to **app>views>contact** 

<br>

#### ___J - Make Email Signups Work (Optional)
* Copy the code from <a href="https://github.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/blob/master/resources/rails_app/app/controllers/signups_controller.rb" target="_blank">app>controllers>signups_controller.rb on GitHub</a> to the same file in your local app 
* You can now sign up by using the signup input box on the homescreen.
<br> 

* View all Signups
	* Lets look at signups in the rails console first 
	* Copy the code from <a href="https://github.com/dladowitz/coding-for-non-coders/blob/master/resources/rails_app/app/views/signups/index.html.erb" target="_blank">app>views>signups>index.html.erb on GitHub</a> to the same file in your local app 

<br>

##### ___K - Push to Github and Heroku
* **git add .**
* **git commit -m "making updates to lots O' things"**
* **git push origin master && git push heroku master**

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>


### 8. SQL

#### ___A - SQLite3

* Super simple. 
* Everything is stored in one file. 
* Not good for real apps
* Let's view the data
	* Download a viewer at <a href="http://sqlitebrowser.org" target="_blank">sqlitebrowser.org</a>
	* Install and Open
	* Go find your Rails database file in db>development.sqlite3
	* Click on the Browse Data Button
	* Try executing a SQL query
		* **SELECT * FROM cat_gifs WHERE ID>1**
* <a href="hhttp://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_select.asp" target="_blank">SQL tutorials</a>

#### ___B - Other SQL Versions
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Oracle SQL
* DB2

#### ___C - Non SQL Versions
* MongoDB
* CouchDB
* Amazon SimpleDB
* Riak
* Neo4J

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>

### 9. What about APIs?
* Let's look at Reddit's cat gifs page 
	* <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CatGifs/" target="_blank" >Reddit Cat Gifs</a>

* Now lets look at the api version of the same page 
	* <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CatGifs/.json" target="_blank">Reddit Cat Gifs API Page</a>
	
* If you don't want to become blind and insane you should use a <a href="http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/" target="_blank"	/>Json Editor</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc" target="_blank"/>Json Viewer</a>
		
<br>

* Ok, what if we want to pull reddit's cat gifs into our app?
* Luckily all that code has already been included. We just need to enable it. 
	* In **app>controllers>cat_gifs_controller.rb** uncomment lines 10 and 11
	* Wait, what's a <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_comments.htm" target="_blank">comment</a>?
	 
* Refresh your browser and you'll see images pulled from Reddit's api
